Dear Graduate Review Committee,

When I started attending computer science classes at the college level, I thought a bachelors degree would be the end of college. During two decades it took to complete my bachelors I was extremely fortunate to work with a very diverse collection of businesses, from individual startups to multinational corporations. What I found was my passion shifted from writing computer software and into the deeper integration of how software is used and licensed in an organization. Working with companies to advise them on not only the software to purchase to run their organization, but also how to license their software for others to use. I returned to college to complete a Masters of Business Administration to learn more about how businesses are structured and run, and gain experience to with many different aspects of business. Now I'm ready to combine my experience and background to help business use and license IP.

The MSBA program will help me translate data to understandable metrics to aid in decision making for businesses. I want to be able to help analyze cost data, use and demand for software and applications to help business determine if they are viable projects to either continue producing or being producing. By increasing my experience in cloud and big data space, I can help business understand the data they already have and how to shape their software offerings around the market potentials.
