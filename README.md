# What I'm providing:

A sticker, of a penguin, The first time I saw a tux sticker in the wild was at a downtown Missoula coffee shop. In a town where most laptops are covered with ski resort and national park stickers it caught my eye. I knew a little about Linux at the time, enough to know a new version was just released and I used that as an ice breaker to start a conversation. He was aware of the new version but hadn't upgraded himself. After the short conversation I found out he was a lawyer who was running his own law firm completely on Linux. We parted ways but agreed to meet the following week for lunch.

I had installed Linux on a few computer before, but never stopped to think who developed it, or why I could could download it for free from the internet. In the time between the coffee shop and the lunch meeting, I dove into Open Source to learn as much as I could about it. I discovered it was much more then just free software. opened my eyes to a revolution that was quietly starting in dark offices and university basements but quickly moving to the light. 

During the meal he explained to me, how he is able to ... What I learned during the lunch meeting, not only was that not the only way to aquire software, the software purchased in stores was heavily restricted and locked down compared to this new style of software, called open source software. Open source doesn't mean free, companies can charge for the software or charge for support, but the users are allow to do more with it and are not tied to heavily restrictive commercial licenses.

it means it's not only allowed it's promoted to take the software to extend and modify the source code.

Going beyond just walking the walk, I've talked the talk with my own personal projects. All of my own personal projects I've released the source code, by sharing the source code for the projects I've developed, not only have I been able to pass only the knowledge I've learned in developing the code, other people have been able to take my code and use it in ways that I would never have imagined.

Open source movement goes beyond the source code and into other areas, allowing companies to share manuals and guides to help repair physical goods. 

I want to help companies, as they grow in a sustainable way. I've found great joy in helping start ups use open source tools to build their business. I've helped with the formation of many companies, all which use open source software to deliver services to their customers. I'm able to help these companies navigate the startup waters and file formation documents with the state, market their services to their potential clients but quickly I get to a point where my knowledge isn't there and I need to refer them to a qualified business lawyer for legal questions. 

I want to help companies protect their IP, earn a profit and make the world a better place. Open source has proven time and again this is possible, and tight copyright and restrictive licensing is not the only way to be successful.
