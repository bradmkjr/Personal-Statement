# Personal-Statement

# What they asked for:

## UMT
The personal statement should provide information about yourself that you consider significant to our evaluation of your file. We are interested in learning about the qualities that you would bring to the legal profession, the law school classroom, and the community. You may wish to describe a significant experience in your life or to discuss your interest in or motivation for attending law school. A typical personal statement is 2-3 pages. It will be evaluated for writing ability as well as content. Do not treat your personal statement as a narrative of your resume.

## UNH
We want to hear from you. Your personal statement of two pages (double-spaced) is required and must be submitted electronically. We’d like you to tell us why you are applying to law school and why UNH Law specifically. What motivates you to become a lawyer? This is your opportunity to share what makes you unique. Share your abilities, your character and your experiences. We consider this statement seriously in our decision-making and expect it to be concise and well-written.

# What I'm providing:

It all started with an innocent little sticker. Sitting at a coffee shop in downtown Missoula, I noticed a small penguin sticker on a laptop, which stood out from the typical ski resort and national park stickers seen around the city. I didn't know much more than "tux" was the mascot of a popular alternative operating system, one I had very little experience with but had an interest in learning more about. I used the sticker as an ice breaker to talk with the individual and find out more about how he was using Linux. He wasn't just using Linux as a hobby, but he was a lawyer running his entire law firm on the Linux operating system. We parted ways but agreed to meet the following week for lunch to discuss the opportunity of working together.

Linux wasn't completely new to me; I had installed it on a few old systems as a test but never stopped to think who developed it, or why. In the time between the coffee shop and the lunch meeting, I dove into the open-source movement to learn as much as I could about it. I discovered it was much more than just an alternative to main stream software. The research opened my eyes to a revolution that was quietly starting in back offices and university basements. Since high school, I had been working on computers, but I had accepted the only way to get software was to go to a store and purchase a boxed copy. What I learned during the lunch meeting, not only was that not the only way to acquire software, but the software purchased in stores was heavily restricted and locked down. Open-source software licensing is more permissive, encouraging the use and reuse of software beyond the original developers intentions. Open-source doesn't always mean free, it means the code behind the software is included in the distribution. The lawyer had a few projects, based on open-source software, he needed help modifying and extending for his firm. At the end of the lunch meeting, the lawyer extended an offer to work for his law firm to help develop software to serve the legal community.

After the lunch meeting, I felt awakened and ready to embraced the new ethos of open-source software. I had seen the light and knew a revolution was on the horizon. This ethos excited me. Being able to share and collaborate with individuals all over the world, in the common language of code, to work towards a greater good. By sharing the source code for the projects, not only have I been able to pass on the knowledge gained, in developing the code, but other people have also been able to take my code and extend it for their needs.

I have continued to be a supporter and advocate for the use of open-source software with the many projects and opportunities following the time at the law firm. When suggesting to a client that they should license their software under an open-source license they freak out and instantly get worried. What I have to do is remind them, that the reason why they can be successful and even afford to embark on the project is that their project will be built on a foundation of open-source technology shared by others. From the operating system and software on the server to the editing tools on the developers’ desktops are all projects shared by their original developers in support of the movement.

Many companies need help, as they grow sustainably. The greatest joy for me has come from helping startups use open-source tools to build their business. With the formation of each new business, I'm presented a new series of challenges and opportunities to explore different tools and techniques on how to apply open-source licenses for their unique situation. Many companies, of all sizes, struggle with using open-source software correctly. This is my motivation and focus, to help companies navigate the open-source waters, allowing them to benefit from open-source without violating the licenses they accepted when downloading the software.
