Share your abilities, your character and your experiences. We consider this statement seriously in our decision-making and expect it to be concise and well-written.

# What I'm providing:

My first conversation with a lawyer started because of a sticker on a laptop. That innocent little penguin sticker. 

The sticker was a mascot for a revolution, to overthrow the establishment, and move the power to the people. Tux represents the idea of free and open software, the ability for people to share software openly and freely. 

For over a decade my understanding of software meant going to a store and purchasing a boxed copy of a program, similar to buying a physical DVD movie. Very similar to the movie, the software was controlled under a strict copyright license. In the same way it would be illegal to have a public showing of a movie, it's illegal to try and modify the copyrighted software. Open Source software takes a completely approach. It not only allows modification, but promotes it. 

The conversation in coffee shop lead to follow up conversation over sushi, and a deeper discussion of how was using Open Source software in his law firm. It opened my eyes to a completely different world of software and business. He extended an offer to work for his law firm to help develop software to serve the legal community. 

I felt awakened after my time at the law firm and fully embraced the new ethos of open source software. I have been fortunate to continue to be a supporter and advocate for the use of open source software with all of the projects I've worked on since then.
