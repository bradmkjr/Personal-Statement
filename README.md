# What I'm providing:

It all started with an innocent little sticker. Sitting at a coffee shop in downtown Missoula, I noticed a small penguin sticker on a laptop, which stood out from the normal ski resort and national park stickers seen around the city. I didn't really know much more then tux was the mascot of a popular alternative operating system, one I had very little experience with but had interest in learning more about. I used the sticker as an ice breaker to talk with the individual and find out more about how he was using Linux. He wasn't just using Linux as a hobby but he was a lawyer running his entire law firm on the Linux operating system. We parted ways but agreed to meet the following week for lunch to discuss the opportunity of working together.

Since childhood, I had been working on computers, but I had accepted the only way to get software was to go to a store and purchase a boxed copy. What I learned during the lunch meeting, not only was that not the only way to aquire software, the software purchased in stores was heavily restricted and locked down compared to the alternative, called open source software. Open source doesn't mean free, it means the code behind the software is included in the distribution. It's not only allowed it's promoted to take the software to extend and modify the source code to make the software work better for each unique situation and share forward those changes with others. 

Linux wasn't completely new to me, I had installed it on a few old system as an test, but never stopped to think who developed it, or why. In the time between the coffee shop and the lunch meeting, I dove into Open Source movement to learn as much as I could about it. I discovered it was much more then just sharing source code. The research opened my eyes to a revolution that was quietly starting in back offices and university basements but quickly moving to the light. At the end of the lunch meeting, the lawyer extended an offer to work for his law firm to help develop software to serve the legal community.

I felt awakened after my time at the law firm and fully embraced the new ethos of open source software. I have been fortunate to continue to be a supporter and advocate for the use of open source software with all of the projects I've worked on since then. I had seen the light and new a revolution was on the horizon. This ethos really excited me. Being able to share and collaborate with individuals all over the world, in the common language of code, to work towards a greater good. By sharing the source code for the projects I've developed, not only have I been able to pass only the knowledge I've learned in developing the code, other people have been able to take my code and use it in ways that I would never have imagined.

The sticker was a mascot for a revolution, to overthrow the establishment, and move the power to the people. Tux represents the idea of free and open software, the ability for people to share software openly and freely.  It not only allows modification, but promotes it. Using open source software is not just about free software. For many people, who are willing to violate copyright and license agreements, pirating software appears to be the same as open source. This is one of the misunderstandings I've worked hard to educate people on. 

Many times, when I've suggested to a client we should license their software under open source license they freak out and instantly get worried their competition is going to steal their code and put them out of business. What I have to do is remind them, that the reason why they are able to be successful and even afford to embark on the project is because a large portion, if not the entire project will be built on a foundation of open source technology. From the operating system and software on the server to the editing tools on the developers desktops are all projects shared by their original developers. 

I want to help companies, as they grow in a sustainable way. I've found great joy in helping start ups use open source tools to build their business. I've helped with the formation of many companies, all which use open source software to deliver services to their customers. I'm able to help these companies navigate the startup waters and file formation documents with the state, market their services to their potential clients but quickly I get to a point where my knowledge isn't there and I need to refer them to a qualified business lawyer for legal questions.
