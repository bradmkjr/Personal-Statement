# What I'm providing:

It all started with an innocent little sticker. Sitting at a coffee shop in downtown Missoula, I noticed a small penguin sticker on a laptop, which stood out from the typical ski resort and national park stickers seen around the city. I didn't know much more than Tux was the mascot of an alternative operating system, one I had minimal experience with but had an interest in learning more. I used the sticker as an ice breaker to talk with the individual and found out how he was using Linux. He wasn't using Linux as a hobby; he was a lawyer running his entire law firm on the Linux operating system. We parted ways but agreed to meet the following week for lunch to discuss the opportunity of working together.

Linux wasn't completely new to me; I had installed it on a few old systems as a test. I had never stopped to think about who developed Linux or why. In the time between the coffee shop and the lunch meeting, I dove into the open-source movement to learn as much as I could about it. I discovered it was much more than just an alternative to mainstream software. The research opened my eyes to a revolution that was quietly starting in back offices and university basements. Since high school, I have been working on computers. I had accepted the only way to get software was to go to a store and purchase a boxed copy. During the lunch meeting, I learned that the software purchased in stores was heavily restricted and locked down. Open-source software licensing is more permissive, encouraging the use and reuse of software beyond the original developer's intentions. The lawyer needed help working with open-source software to add additional features not included by the original developers. At the end of the lunch meeting, the lawyer extended an offer to work to help enhance the software for his firm for their specific needs.

After the lunch meeting, I felt awakened and ready to embrace the new ethos of open-source software. I had seen the light and knew a revolution was on the horizon. This ethos excited me. Being able to share and collaborate with individuals all over the world in the common language of code. By sharing the source code for the projects, not only have I been able to pass on the knowledge gained in developing the code, but other people have also been able to take my code and extend it for their use cases.

I have continued to be a supporter and advocate for the use of open-source software following my time at the law firm. When suggesting to a client that they should license their software under an open-source license they freak out and instantly get worried. What I have to do is remind them of the reason why they can be successful. Having their projects built on a foundation of open-source software keeps the costs manageable. From the operating system and software on the server to the editing tools on the developers' desktops are all projects shared by their original developers in support of the movement.

Many companies need help as they grow sustainably. The greatest joy for me has come from helping startups use open-source tools to build their business. With the formation of each new business, I've presented a new series of challenges and opportunities to explore different tools and techniques. Working on how to apply open-source licenses for their unique situation. Many companies of all sizes struggle with using open-source software correctly. My motivation is to help companies navigate the open-source waters. By allowing them to benefit from open-source software without violating the software license.
