# Personal-Statement

# What they asked for:

## UMT
The personal statement should provide information about yourself that you consider significant to our evaluation of your file. We are interested in learning about the qualities that you would bring to the legal profession, the law school classroom, and the community. You may wish to describe a significant experience in your life or to discuss your interest in or motivation for attending law school. A typical personal statement is 2-3 pages. It will be evaluated for writing ability as well as content. Do not treat your personal statement as a narrative of your resume.

## UNH
We want to hear from you. Your personal statement of two pages (double-spaced) is required and must be submitted electronically. Weâ€™d like you to tell us why you are applying to law school and why UNH Law specifically. What motivates you to become a lawyer? This is your opportunity to share what makes you unique. Share your abilities, your character and your experiences. We consider this statement seriously in our decision-making and expect it to be concise and well-written.

# What I'm providing:

It started with a sticker, an innocent little penguin sticker on a laptop. Sitting in a coffee shop in downtown Missoula, I noticed the sticker on another patrons laptop. I wasn't fully aware of what that penguin truly represented, but I knew enough at the time that a new version of a popular Linux package just got released so I used it as an ice breaker to start a conversation. He was aware of the new version but hadn't upgraded himself. After the short conversation I found out he was a lawyer who was running his own lawfirm completely on open source software, a term as the time I didn't really understand. We parted ways but agreed to meet the following week for lunch to discuss the opportunity of working with him.

I had been working on computers for a long time, but I had always accepted the only way to get software was to go to a store and purchase a boxed copy. What I learned during the lunch meeting, not only was that not the only way to aquire software, the software purchased in stores was heavily restricted and locked down compared to this new category, called open source software. Open source doesn't mean free, it means it's not only allowed it's promoted to take the software to extend and modify the source code.

I had seen the light and new a revolution was on the horizon. This ethos really attracted me. Being able to share and collaborate with individuals all over the world, in the common language of code, to work towards a greater good. By using open source software, I was able to build websites for local non-profits, at very affordable rates that may not be possible if they had been required to purchase commercial licenses for all the different tools used to develope a website. With this permissive licensing, I could even take pieces others had built for other projects and reused for my projects.

By sharing the source code for the projects I've developed, not only have I been able to pass only the knowledge I've learned in developing the code, other people have been able to take my code and use it in ways that I would never have imagined. 

While attending multiple conferences in Las Vegas, I was able to meet the individuals who benefited from the sharing of my code, but also meet and thank those who I used as foundations for my own projects. One package I wrote for doing manual inspection of power line transmission towers, was being investigated as a potential foundation to do the daily inspections of amusement park equipment. 

There is nothing wrong with making money, and being successful, but if that success comes at the cost of people not being able to maintain or use items they bought because of restrictive licensing or tightly controlled supply chains, it's time to change and work together.

I want to help companies, as they grow in a sustainable way. I want to help companies protect their IP, earn a profit and make the world a better place. Open source has proven time and again this is possible, and tight copyright and restrictive licensing is not the only way.


Companies have been very successful offering their open source software for free, with a business model of paid support programs.
