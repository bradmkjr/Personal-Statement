# Personal-Statement

# What they asked for:

## UMT
The personal statement should provide information about yourself that you consider significant to our evaluation of your file. We are interested in learning about the qualities that you would bring to the legal profession, the law school classroom, and the community. You may wish to describe a significant experience in your life or to discuss your interest in or motivation for attending law school. A typical personal statement is 2-3 pages. It will be evaluated for writing ability as well as content. Do not treat your personal statement as a narrative of your resume.

## UNH
We want to hear from you. Your personal statement of two pages (double-spaced) is required and must be submitted electronically. Weâ€™d like you to tell us why you are applying to law school and why UNH Law specifically. What motivates you to become a lawyer? This is your opportunity to share what makes you unique. Share your abilities, your character and your experiences. We consider this statement seriously in our decision-making and expect it to be concise and well-written.

# What I'm providing:

Technology moves at the speed of light, while law moves closer to the speed of sound. As new technologies emerge and gain popularity and acceptence, the laws are often slow to adept and change to support the new technologies. Unlike physical goods and services, software can be replicated and distributed across the globe in near real time. This distribution and reach of software means that those who are willing and able to share their code are able to make a global impact. Open source code, which is software willingly shared by the original developers, is the foundation of this movement. Software packages from just a few dozen lines to millions of lines of code have been shared with open source licenses allowing anyone with an internet connection to use and extend the original program. This extension of previous work, sharing of new work and discussion and promotion of the movement has a core tenant of my beliefs for the past 15 years.
